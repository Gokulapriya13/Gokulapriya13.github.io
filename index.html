    <h4>Personality</h4>
    <p><a href="http://pixar.wikia.com/wiki/Boo">Boo</a> is a 2-year-old <strong>cute baby</strong></p> 
    <p>Boo is a nauseatingly adorable toddler who is curious, and naive. She can speak, but has baby, gibberish vocabulary. The only actual words she says in the film are "Boo!", "Kitty!", and "Mike Wazowski!". In other ways, she is advanced for her age, such as already being potty trained. This is seen when she shows to Sulley that she needs to go to the bathroom and doesn't need help. </p>
   <h4>Appearance</h4>
   <p>Boo has brown eyes as well as brown hair in pigtails with pink hair ties. She is shown wearing a pink nightshirt, purple capris leggings, and white socks. She makes friends with Mike Wazowski and Sulley after she sneaks through her door into Monsters, Inc.</p>
